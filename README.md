# Confession Bot
Its a Discord bot that sends a message to a discord channel anonomously. I use it for anonomous messages about anything the brain thinks of.
It attaches a random name to each message for easy response and discussion. 

## Bot in Production:

Here, a user has sent a private message to the bot. The bot relayed it anonomously to a public chat.

This is a response to the message in a seprate channel. <br>
This is a rather silly example, but topics can get serious depending on the group that uses the bot. <br> <br> In cases of unecuseable messages, there is a block list implemented where messages that contain negative words are manualy reviewed.
